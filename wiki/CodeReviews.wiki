#summary Code review in ots project.

For now, we don't use our own code review system. Instead, you can use Chromium project's Rietveld server (http://codereview.chromium.org/). Here is the instruction how to use the server:

 # checkout Chromium source code (http://dev.chromium.org/developers).
  # install depot_tools.
  # checkout Chromium code from their SVN server.
  # run "gclient sync" to pull OTS code into chromium/src/third_party/ots/.
 # modify OTS code under chromium/src/third_party/ots/.
  * {{{cd chromium/src/third_party/ots/}}}
  * {{{emacs src/cmap.cc}}}   # for example
 # start code review using gcl (http://dev.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code). Please assign an OTS project member (e.g. yusukes@chromium.org) as a reviewer.
  * {{{cd chromium/src/third_party/ots/}}}
  * {{{gcl change your_change_name}}}   # you can safely ignore the "WARNING: Creating CL in a read-only checkout" warning.
  * {{{gcl upload your_change_name}}}
 # after the code review, the reviewer will land your patch.
